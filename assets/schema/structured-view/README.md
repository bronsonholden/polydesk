Structured View
===============

Structured views are user-configured document organization based on any
number of criteria that are used to present content in a logical manner
without any explicit folder hierarchy.

Structured views are generated dynamically when requested, and are collections
of documents pulled from the parent view that match its criteria. Documents
that don't match the criteria of any sub-views will be listed when the
view is active.
